            <div className="indivs">
              <p>If you have a written agreement with Host Merchant Services that specifically addresses how you may use the company’s Brand and Features, you do not need to go through the approval process here unless you want to do something with the Brand or Features that was not authorized in the existing agreement. Otherwise, the only time you can use HMS Brand or Features without advance written permission is if tehre is clear and express language on our website stating that y ou can use that Brand or Features without first obtaining permission.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="indivs">

              <p><strong>What is a trademark?</strong></p>
            </div>
            <div className="indivs">
              <p>A trademark is a word, name, symbol or device (or a combination thereof) that identifies the goods or services of a person or company and distinguishes them from the goods and services of others. A trademark assures consumers of consistent quality with respect to those goods or services and aids in their promotion.</p>

              <p><strong>Why is it important to use branded features correctly?</strong></p>
            </div>
            <div className="indivs">
              <p>Rights to a trademark can last indefinitely if the owner continues to use the mark to identify its goods and services. If trademarks are not used properly, they may be lost and one of the company’s most important assets may lose all of its value. Rights may be lost not only because of a trademark owner’s improper use of the mark, but through improper use of the trademark by the public.</p>
